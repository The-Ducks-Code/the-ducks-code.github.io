I bought the Secret Lair x Hatsune Miku: Sakura Superstar Drop because I like Hatsune Miku. And the commander that seemed the most interesting and the most fun in the drop was <a class="card" href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1602/feather-the-redeemed">Miku, the Renowned (Feather, the Redeemed).<span  class="large"><img class="large-image" width="50%" height="50%" src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/9/7/97162e95-5cc6-4c83-996c-622bc25e7d0f.jpg"></span></a>   So I went to EDHRec and started a list. The deck is mainly built around spamming 3-4 insants on your turn and keeping up some land for protection of Miku. I still would like to add a few things to the list such as <a class="card" href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/222/fighter-class">Fighter Class<span class="large"><img class="large-image" width="50%" height="50%" src="https://cards.scryfall.io/large/front/d/5/d54a8329-b940-42c9-8ace-1d74407d14cb.jpg"></span></a>, if it is on there when you see this then I forget to update this lmao.

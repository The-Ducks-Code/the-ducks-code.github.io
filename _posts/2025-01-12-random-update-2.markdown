First blog of 2025 (last year had only one ;-; i keep forgetting about it). Like last year I have been playing The Binding of Issac: Repentance over my Christmas break, this time I have played 55 hours in the last two weeks (last year was 40 lmao). I got into vinyl after I got a record player for chirstmas, I also got into Persona 4 which is cool. I have also finally accepted that I am not gonna be quiet about my poltical beliefs, so yeah, free palestine, we should become socialist and fuck trump, if you don't like that, then leave ig.

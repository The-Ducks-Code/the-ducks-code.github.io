I set this blog up and completely forgot about it lol. Here I'll talk about my favorite Game I guess. My favorite video game is Red Dead Redepmtion 2, this game, in my opinion, has an AMAZING story, level of detail, cast of characters and voice actors, VERY fun gameplay, and TONS of stuff to do outside of the Main story. For one, there are TONS of side missions to do, so you get even MORE story out of the 60-70 hour playthrough. There are also tons of voice lines that change based on your honor level, which also changes the ending of the game, so you can play through the game multiple times. When playing through it, I felt like I only scratched the surface of what the game had to offer. If you can, I would wholeheartedly recommend this MASTERPIECE.

Wow I'm so consistent with these lol. So it's been like 11 months since I wrote one of these, a lot has happened since then. I got a boyfriend (OH MY GOD GAY !!!!) and he's so perfect and amazing  :). I also applied to college and am waiting for responses. 
I'm very excited to be done with high school and to actually have fun classes in college. 
I've also started reading Marxist theory like a good little comrade. I read <a class="card" href="https://www.michael-parenti.org/book-blackshirts-and-reds">Michael Parenti's Blackshirts & Reds<span  class="large"><img class="large-image" width="50%" height="50%" src="/images/blackshirtsreds.png"></span></a> which was a very good book that explained the basic history of fascism and leftism and their effects, as well as capitalism's basic contradictions and death toll, among many other things. I have also been reading <a class="card" href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/">Vladimir I. Lenin's Imperialism: the Highest Stage of Capitalism<span  class="large"><img class="large-image" width="50%" height="50%" src="/images/imperialism.png"></span></a> which has been amazing so far, it explains the inevitablity of capitalism to turn to monopolism and imperialism, it also explains how imperialistic countries exploit the global south for their resources and labor.

Anyways, I just felt like yapping, it'll probably be like a year until I update this again lmao bye !!
